<h1><b>PROGRAMMING FUN</b></h1>
<p>After thinking about it, although programming is now a passion for me, I remembered that it hasn't always been fun for me.
Mostly when I started, I would get stuck for days on a problem. 
Sometimes I would completely lose hope and say: "This is not for me.
I tried everything, and it still does not work. I'm not that good."
This point always returns in all of my productivity articles. You must define goals.
Without goals, it's challenging to feel comfortable and enjoy what you are doing as a developer.
Writing code is like playing golf. When you start, it's not fun. You need to learn everything: 
which driver to use for hitting the ball in such a way, how to position yourself, and so on. 
The pleasure will come as you go along, begin to understand things, and start to have fun with them.
When you are a developer, you always need to learn new things to stay up to date. 
Everything is evolving quickly, and you can't be left behind.
Boredom or lack of fun occurs when you no longer feel like you are growing or learning.
I tried to round up some essential tips to help you have fun while programming. 
If you have any other advice or suggestions to make it more fun, feel free to leave a comment or send me a message.
